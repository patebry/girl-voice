        <h2>Getting Started</h2>

        <div className="faq-item">
          <h3>How long does voice feminization take?</h3>
          <p>
            Voice feminization typically takes 6-18 months of consistent daily practice to achieve
            significant, lasting changes. Individual results vary based on:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Starting voice characteristics</li>
            <li>Practice consistency and quality</li>
            <li>Individual anatomical factors</li>
            <li>Training methods used</li>
            <li>Professional guidance received</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Most people notice initial changes within 4-8 weeks, with more substantial progress
            after 3-6 months of dedicated practice.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="faq-item">
          <h3>Can I learn voice feminization on my own?</h3>
          <p>
            Self-training is possible but challenging. While many resources exist for independent
            learning, working with a qualified speech-language pathologist or voice coach significantly
            improves results and reduces injury risk. Consider professional guidance especially if:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>You're experiencing vocal strain or pain</li>
            <li>Progress has plateaued after several months</li>
            <li>You have specific medical concerns</li>
            <li>You want to achieve professional voice quality</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div className="faq-item">
          <h3>What's the difference between voice feminization and singing training?</h3>
          <p>
            Voice feminization focuses on everyday speech patterns, while singing training develops
            musical vocal abilities. Key differences include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Goals:</strong> Feminine speech vs. artistic expression</li>
            <li><strong>Techniques:</strong> Conversational patterns vs. musical scales</li>
            <li><strong>Range:</strong> Speaking range vs. extended singing range</li>
            <li><strong>Application:</strong> Daily communication vs. performance</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            However, both benefit from similar foundational skills like breath support and
            vocal health practices.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="faq-item">
          <h3>How much should I practice daily?</h3>
          <p>
            Start with 10-15 minutes daily and gradually increase to 30-45 minutes as your voice
            adapts. Quality is more important than quantity. Recommended schedule:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Week 1-2:</strong> 10 minutes daily</li>
            <li><strong>Week 3-4:</strong> 15 minutes daily</li>
            <li><strong>Month 2:</strong> 20 minutes daily</li>
            <li><strong>Month 3+:</strong> 30-45 minutes daily</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Always include warm-up and cool-down periods, and take rest days if experiencing fatigue.

        <h2>Safety and Health</h2>

        <div className="faq-item">
          <h3>Is voice feminization safe?</h3>
          <p>
            When done properly with gradual progression and good technique, voice feminization is safe.
            However, improper technique can cause:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Vocal strain and fatigue</li>
            <li>Vocal cord swelling or nodules</li>
            <li>Hoarseness or voice loss</li>
            <li>Throat pain and discomfort</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            To stay safe: progress gradually, never practice through pain, stay hydrated, and
            seek professional guidance when needed.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="faq-item">
          <h3>What are the warning signs of vocal damage?</h3>
          <p>
            Stop practicing immediately and consult a healthcare professional if you experience:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Persistent hoarseness lasting more than 2 weeks</li>
            <li>Complete voice loss for more than 3 days</li>
            <li>Pain when speaking or swallowing</li>
            <li>Blood in saliva or when coughing</li>
            <li>Sudden change in voice quality</li>
            <li>Difficulty breathing while speaking</li>
          </ul>

        <div className="faq-item">
          <h3>Should I avoid certain foods or drinks during training?</h3>
          <p>
            Some substances can negatively affect your voice:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Before practice, avoid:</strong> Dairy (increases mucus), caffeine (dehydrating),
            alcohol (dehydrating), spicy foods (can cause reflux)</li>
            <li><strong>Best for vocal health:</strong> Room temperature water, herbal tea,
            fruits with high water content</li>
            <li><strong>Stay hydrated:</strong> 8-10 glasses of water daily</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div className="faq-item">
          <h3>Can I practice when I have a cold or sore throat?</h3>
          <p>
            It's best to avoid intensive voice training when sick. Your vocal cords are already
            inflamed and more susceptible to injury. Instead:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Take complete vocal rest until symptoms improve</li>
            <li>Stay hydrated and use a humidifier</li>
            <li>Avoid throat clearing and coughing when possible</li>
            <li>Resume training gradually after recovery</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Technique and Practice</h2>

        <div className="faq-item">
          <h3>Why does my voice sound unnatural or "fake"?</h3>
          <p>
            This is common during early training and usually indicates:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Over-modification:</strong> Pushing pitch too high or changing too many elements at once</li>
            <li><strong>Tension:</strong> Forcing sounds rather than using proper breath support</li>
            <li><strong>Inconsistency:</strong> Not maintaining changes throughout speech</li>
            <li><strong>Lack of emotional expression:</strong> Focusing only on technical aspects</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Solutions: Make smaller, gradual changes; focus on one element at a time;
            practice emotional expression; ensure proper breath support.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="faq-item">
          <h3>My voice keeps cracking. What am I doing wrong?</h3>
          <p>
            Voice cracking usually indicates vocal strain or improper technique:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Reduce intensity:</strong> Lower your target pitch temporarily</li>
            <li><strong>Focus on breath support:</strong> Ensure adequate diaphragmatic breathing</li>
            <li><strong>Warm up properly:</strong> Always start with gentle exercises</li>
            <li><strong>Stay hydrated:</strong> Dry vocal cords are more prone to breaks</li>
            <li><strong>Rest if needed:</strong> Take a day off if cracking persists</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div className="faq-item">
          <h3>How do I know if I'm making progress?</h3>
          <p>
            Track progress through multiple methods:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Daily recordings:</strong> Compare the same phrase over time</li>
            <li><strong>Pitch analysis apps:</strong> Monitor frequency ranges and consistency</li>
            <li><strong>Feedback from others:</strong> Ask trusted friends about changes</li>
            <li><strong>Comfort level:</strong> Voice feels more natural and less strained</li>
            <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Able to maintain voice qualities longer</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Progress often happens gradually and may not be immediately obvious to you.

        <div className="faq-item">
          <h3>Should I use voice-changing apps or software?</h3>
          <p>
            Voice-changing technology can be helpful for specific purposes but has limitations:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Helpful for:</strong> Understanding target sounds, temporary assistance,
            voice exploration</li>
            <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> Often sounds artificial, doesn't build natural skills,
            may create unrealistic expectations</li>
            <li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Use as a supplement to, not replacement for,
            natural voice training</li>
          </ul>

        <div className="faq-item">
          <h3>What's the difference between head voice and chest voice?</h3>
          <p>
            These terms describe different resonance patterns:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Chest voice:</strong> Resonance felt in chest, typically lower pitched,
            fuller sound</li>
            <li><strong>Head voice:</strong> Resonance felt in head/face, typically higher pitched,
            brighter sound</li>
            <li><strong>For feminization:</strong> Generally want more head voice and less chest voice</li>
            <li><strong>Balance is key:</strong> Complete elimination of chest voice sounds unnatural</li>
